# Issues:

# The perl version of MinGW and DJGPP is 5.8.8. The pod2man command of perl
# 5.8.8 does not yet have the options -u, --utf8, and does support the
# =encoding command.  The =encoding command and the --utf8 option are supported
# since perl 5.10.1.
# Erwin W.

# Dos2unix 6.0.5: Forget Latin-1, we do now only UTF-8.
