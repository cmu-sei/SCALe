SCALe : SCALe Quick Start Demo for Auditors
============================================

### Please note: This section has not been fully updated for SCALe version 3. Screenshots and usage information may be deprecated, and new features not introduced.

### See section [The SCALe Web App](The-SCALe-Web-App.md) for updated feature and use information for SCALe version 3.

Demo Overview
-------------

In this demo, we use SCALe to audit the source code of the common UNIX
utility
[dos2unix](http://waterlan.home.xs4all.nl/dos2unix.html){.extlink}![(lightbulb)](images/icons/emoticons/lightbulb_on.png),
version 7.2.2. We evaluate alerts from the static analysis tool
CERT Rosecheckers. We show how to import the output into the SCALe auditing
application. We then show how to use the web application to evaluate
alerts. Finally, we show how to export the results of this evaluation
from the application.

This diagram summarizes the scenario.
