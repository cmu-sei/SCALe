The SCAIFE manual (documentation) copyright covers all pages of the SCAIFE/SCALe manual with filenames that start with text 'SCAIFE' and that copyright is [here](SCAIFE-MANUAL-copyright.md).

The non-SCALe part of the SCAIFE _system_ has limited distribution that is different than the SCALe distribution. [Click here to see the SCAIFE system copyright.](SCAIFE-SYSTEM-copyright.md)

The SCAIFE API definition has its own distribution that is different than the SCAIFE system, SCAIFE manual, and SCALe distribution. The SCAIFE _API_ definition copyright is [here](SCAIFE-API-copyright.md)

Editing the SCAIFE Manual
==================

In SCAIFE, the SCALe & SCAIFE Manual lives in the folder:

  scaife/ui_server_stub/scale.app/doc

All the files are in Markdown format.  To change the manual, edit
these files.  Then, in a terminal, run:

  docker exec scale ./ui_server_stub/scale.app/scripts/builddocs.sh

This will convert the Markdown files to HTML; it is also run as part
of building the scale Docker container. Then refresh your browser.
