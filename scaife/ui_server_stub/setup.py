    Module to facilitate auditing static analysis meta-alerts using classifiers, optional adaptive heuristics, and meta-alert prioritization. The module enables jump-starting labeled datasets using test suites. It is intended to enable a wide range of users (with widely varying datasets, static analysis tools, ranging from having no labeled data to having a lot of labeled data, and regardless of if they have their own statistical experts) to benefit from using classifiers and sophisticated prioritization to automatically triage handling their static analysis meta-alerts.
